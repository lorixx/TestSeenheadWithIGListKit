Messenger seen head movement with IGListKit

Facebook Messenger has a special seen state animation when your message recipient(s) have seen your message. It is available to 1:1 chat as well as group chat.
This github project is to mimic the similar behavior for what the messenger one uses.

We discussed 3 approaches:
1) Using Vanilla UICollectionView 
2) Using IGListKit + custom UICollectionViewLayout
3) Using IGListKit with SupplementaryView

Each of them have very inetersting characteristics, I also made an Medium article about it, enjoy!
